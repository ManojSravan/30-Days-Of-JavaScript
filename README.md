### **🚀 30 Days of JavaScript – My Journey**  

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript** journey!  

I’m **Manoj Sravan**, and this is my personal challenge to **grind JavaScript, solve problems, and level up my skills!** 💪  

Each day, I'll be tackling a new problem, debugging my way through, and documenting my learnings. This isn’t just about writing code—it’s about **understanding concepts, thinking logically, and growing as a developer**.  

---

## **🌟 Day 1: The Counter Function**  
📝 **Problem:** Create a counter function that returns `n` on the first call and increments by `1` on each subsequent call.  

🛠 **What I Tried:**  
✔️ Started with a loop and an array (too complex 🤦‍♂️).  
✔️ Removed the loop and directly incremented the counter.  
✔️ Faced issues where the counter wasn't updating properly.  
✔️ Realized I needed to modify the count **after** returning it.  
✔️ **Solved it using closures!** 🎉  

🧠 **Lesson Learned:** **Closures are powerful!** JavaScript functions can **remember** their surrounding variables even after execution.

## **💡 Why This Challenge?**  
I want to:  
✅ **Master JavaScript** fundamentals.  
✅ **Solve real problems** and think like a developer.  
✅ **Develop consistency**—1 problem a day, no excuses.  
✅ **Build confidence** in problem-solving and debugging.
